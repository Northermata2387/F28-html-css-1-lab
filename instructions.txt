HTML & CSS 1
Summary
In this lab exercise, you will be creating your own page using HTML & CSS. There is nothing to download in Frodo as you’ll be starting from scratch.

Instructions
Decide what you want to make your page about – it could be about a hobby, a book, a movie, an event, a place, or anything else you can think of

Sketch out a basic layout (you can do this anywhere, you won’t be submitting it)

Create a folder for your project, inside the folder, create an index.html file and a styles.css file

In the HTML file, set up your basic structure - doctype, head, body

Start coding! I recommend breaking down your sketch into small parts. Do all of the HTML and then all of the CSS before moving on to the next part. Don’t worry if your code is messy or repetitive right now – you’re learning!

Intermediate
Once you’ve created your basic page, do some HTML & CSS research and see what you can add! We’ll cover classes & ids, the position, display, & flexbox properties, as well as semantic HTML later in this unit; so use your time in this lab to look at other topics. W3Schools and MDN are both great reference sites for HTML & CSS.

Topics to consider:

HTML
tables

audio tags

video tags

HTML entities

CSS
box-shadow

box-sizing

pseudo classes

float

Submit
When you’re done, create a repo on GitHub and push up your code.
